## What is this?
It's a short script I made to check for valid phone numbers within a range (be it area code, or the first 3 digits after that.  With a little alteration, you could also check the last 3 digits, but don't expect me to care enough to do that.)

This script requires that you have a Twilio API Account and the Twilio library installed.

## But why did you make this?  This seems kinda shady tbh

### Please don't misuse this program.  I am not responsible if you decide to do something shady with this script.
