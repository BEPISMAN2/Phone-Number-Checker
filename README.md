## What is this?
It's a short script I made to check for valid phone numbers within a range (be it area code, or the first 3 digits after that.  With a little alteration, you could also check the last 3 digits, but don't expect me to care enough to do that.)

This script requires that you have a Twilio API Account and the Twilio library installed.

## But why did you make this?  This seems kinda shady tbh
Basically, a guy at the train station asked for $40 for a bus ticket, and, like an idiot, I gave it to him.  He gave me his phone number so that he could eventually pay me back, but I didn't get all of it down (again, like an idiot).  As a last resort, I wrote this script to see if I could pin his exact number down.  Long story short, I got way more numbers than I expected, and I wasn't willing to get sent to jail for mass-messaging the entire state of Maine, so I gave up there.

### Please don't misuse this program.  I am not responsible if you decide to do something shady with this script.
